            <p class="para1">
              "This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)"is a song by new wave band
              Talking Heads, released in November 1983 as the second single from
              their fifth album Speaking in Tounges. The lyrics were written by
              David Byrne, and the music was written by Byrne and the other
              members of the band, Chrs Frantz, Tina Weymouth and Jerry
              Harrison."
            </p>
            <p class="para2">
              "In the "Self Interview" on the DVD concept of the concert film
              Stop Making Sense, Byrne states that it is a love song, a topic he
              tends to avoid because it is "kinda big." He also said of the
              song:"
            </p>
            <blockquoute class="block">
              "That's a love song made up almost completely of non sequiturs,
              phrases that may have a strong emotional resonance but dont have
              any narrative qualities. It's a reak honest kind of love song. I
              don't think I've ever done a real love song before. Mine always
              had a sort of reservation or a twist. I tried to write one that
              wasn't corny, that didn't sound stupid or lame the way many do. I
              think I succeeded; I was pretty happy with that."
