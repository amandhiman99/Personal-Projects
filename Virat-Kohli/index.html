swinging it and ask his father to bowl at him. Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School. In 1988, the West
Delhi Cricket Academy was created, and Kohli, a nine-year-old, was part of its first intake. Kohli's fatehr took him to the academy after their neighbours
suggested that "Virat shouldn't waste his time in street cricket and instead join a proffesional club". Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar
Sharma. Sharma recounts Kohli's early days at his academy, "He oozed talent. It was so difficult to keep him quiet. He was natural in whatever he did and 
I was most impressed with his attitude. He was ready to bat at any spot and I had to litteraly push him home after the training sessions. He just wouldn't
leave. Apart from sports, Kohli was good at academics as well, and his teachers remember him as a "bright and alert child".
