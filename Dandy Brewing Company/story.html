    Even dandies have origins.

    <p>
    
      The story goes back. Two high-school classmates begin a business, they graduated and went their
      separate ways. They cross paths again years later to discuss an interest, and a passion
    
    </p>
    
    <p>
    
      In the fall of 2013, the Alberta Gaming and Liqour Commission made sweeping changes to brewing 
      industry in Alberta, allowing small craft breweries to exist. It came at a perfect time.
      For years Ben Leon, a techer , and Dylan Nosal, a chef, had been growing their home- brew experience,
      not only in size but also in knowledge. Over the course of a few years of practice, learning, and many
      batches, they began brewing exceptional beers on home-built 1BBL brewhouse.
    
    </p>
    
    <p>
    
      While honing skills, the two were developing keen taste for the growing selection of Craft beer flooding
      into Alberta. Much of their guidance came from Matt Gaetz, a veteran of the liqour business in Alberta,
      a close friend. Between the three of them, the topic of starting something amazing often came up
      over beers and brewing. They knew they wanted it, they just weren't sure it was possible under old laws.
      Changes in law meant it was possible.
    
    </p>
    
    <p>
    
      Dicussion after discussion, batch after batch, ideas developed into plans. What it always boiled down to 
      was that the brewery would have to be exciting, forward thinking, and outside the traditional thought box
      for breweries in the province. Exciting beer styles , quality ingridients, and attention to every detail of
      production.
    
    </p>
      
    
    <p>
      Cue the return of Derek Waghray, a high-school friend studying chemistry on the West coast. On his 
      return to Calgary, and with a new-found interest in brewing craft beer, he got in touch with an old
      high school friend. A home brew batch later, and a discussion of wild dreams, he was added to the 
      group. He was much needed addition bringing expertise in laboratory process and a deep 
      understanding of the science behind the beer.
    
    </p>
    
    <p>
    
      When the laws were officially changed in December 2013, the four Dandies moved quickly to hammer out
      the final details for The Dandy Brewing Company.
    
    </p>
    
    <p>
    
      In January 2014 the Dandy Brewing Company was incorporated. April 2014 the lease was signed. June 
      2014 the brewhouse was built. August 2014 the brewing began. September 2014 the beer hit the 
      shelves. April 2015 the first draught accounts start pouring. November 2015 the Tap Room opened.
      January 2016 a three-fold expansion of capacity was completed.
    
    </p>
    
    <p>
      April 2018 saw the opening of The Dandy Brewing Company and Tasting Room, a new production
      facility and full service tasting tasting room located in heart of Ramsay, Calgary. Fine 
      Dining drinking food. Dandy beers. Dandy cocktails.wine. The full Dandy experience.
