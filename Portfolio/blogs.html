        When I first do watched the movie Interstellar
      </div>
      <div class = "blog1">
        I am always fan of the science and especially the space explorations. On
        March 22, 2016, I first watched the movie interstellar directed by
        Christopher Nolan. This movie is about saving the mankind from the
        consequences of the global warming and dying crops. This movie has the
        most real simulation of the black hole which was discovered to be
        exactly the same as the real blackhole found by the Event Horizon
        Telescope. The cooper station and the robots and these were the most
        advanced a human can get. Though the movie is quite confusing but I like
        the facts that on different planets the simulate the environment like
        wise. If someone can notice on Dr. Miller's water world their is a
        ticking sound every 1.5 seconds which means by each ticking sound a year
        on earth passes by. The lead hero 'Joseph Cooper' when he fell into the
        black hole, and then he can see the most complex 4 dimensional structure
        made by some advance civilisation. There he can see the past and present
        at the same time. The thing which fascinated me was how he can
        communicate with his daughter Murph through different means using morse
        code as well.

      <div class = "blog2">
        It was the day everyone was glued with there television screens and
        mobile phones or radios in rural areas. On April 2nd, 2011 This was the
        day when India take on SriLanka in the Cricket World Cup final 2011. It
        was historic moment as India won the World Cup after 28 years. This was
        also the Sachin Tendulkar, the proclaimed GOD of the cricket. The final
        six by MS Dhoni will always be in hearts of each and every Indian. The
        streets were all crowded, bursting crackers as it was a festival
